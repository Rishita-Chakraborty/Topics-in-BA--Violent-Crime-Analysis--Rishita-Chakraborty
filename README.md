Violent Crime Rate Analysis and Prediction
Here is a description to explain each of the files uploaded to GitHub:

### 1. **Topics in BA - Violent Crimes -4.ipynb**
   - **Description**: This is a Jupyter Notebook file containing the analysis and modeling of violent crime data in California. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and the application of machine learning models to predict violent crime rates. Key techniques employed in the notebook might include data visualization, statistical analysis, and machine learning models such as regression or classification. The notebook aims to showcase various aspects of data analysis and the insights drawn from the violent crime data during the years 2000-2013.

### 2. **Topics in BA Mini Project.pdf**
   - **Description**: This PDF is the report of the mini project related to the analysis of violent crime rates in California. The document provides a detailed explanation of the project goals, methodology, data sources, and key findings. It might include an overview of the dataset, the research question addressed, the steps taken in data preparation, and the results of the modeling and analysis. The PDF report is intended to summarize the work done in the Jupyter Notebook and present the insights in a more structured, formal format.

### 3. **violent-crime-rate-california-2000-2013.csv**
   - **Description**: This is the raw dataset containing violent crime rates in California from 2000 to 2013. The CSV file includes various columns representing the year, crime rates, and potentially other demographic or geographic features relevant to violent crime in California during this period. This dataset is used as the primary input for analysis in the Jupyter Notebook and is the foundation for the modeling and insights presented in both the notebook and the PDF report. 

Together, these files provide a comprehensive approach to analyzing and predicting violent crime rates in California, including the source data, the methodology used in analysis, and the final report with key conclusions.
